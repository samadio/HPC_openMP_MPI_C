The program is not using OMP library, it's actually using . So in order 
to get it to work you can use MKL_NUM_THREADS. Or u can use mp_linpack/bin_intel/intel64 and use xhpl_intel64. Use ldd to see the shared libraries linked to the executable
Why intel is better? the multithread better version of intel is minimizing a lot the overhead given by mpi messages:
in multithread approach intel probably minimizes the message passing, so the resources it takes.
